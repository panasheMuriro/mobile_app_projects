# Local Storage with SharedPreferences
In this lesson, we will learn how to store and retrieve data locally using SharedPreferences, a simple way to persist small amounts of data (e.g., app settings, preferences, or small lists). We'll implement a mini to-do list app to practice the concepts.

## Mini Project: To-Do List App
This app will allow users to:

- Add tasks to a list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Save the tasks locally so they persist even when the app is restarted.
