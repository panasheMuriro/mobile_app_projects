# State Management Counter Demo

- State represents the data or condition of a widget. 
- When state changes, the widget is rebuilt with the updated data.

### Types of Widgets Based on State:

- StatelessWidget: A widget that does not change once itâ€™s built.
- StatefulWidget: A widget that can change over time, requiring re-rendering.

- setState is used to tell Flutter to re-render the widget with the new data.

### Global State Management with Provider

- For larger apps, managing state with setState across multiple widgets can become challenging. Provider is a package that allows you to share and manage state globally across the app.
